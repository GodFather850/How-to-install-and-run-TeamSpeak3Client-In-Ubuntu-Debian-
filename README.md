```

# Alert:Of course, I will include a script in this post: a script called (installts.sh), which is for automatic installation if you keep the run file in the downloads folder, and a script for execution called (ts3.sh), which you can run whenever you need to. You can enter the TeamSpeak client by just running a script.
